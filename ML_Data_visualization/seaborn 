Different btw matplotlib and Seaborn : -
 - reduces the code 
 - can implement graphs easily 
 - more tools 

Dependency of Seaborn :- 
 - python 
 - matplotlib
 - numpy 
 - pandas 

INstallation Seaborn :- 

	pip install seaborn 

	pip install matplotlib

	to use the fucntion in our file or project :-
